/**
 This is the library for IS31FL3731 chip. It supports I2C communication.
 By default, you can use it with a 9x16 LED matrix.
 
 The LED matrix has 16 rows (X0 - X15), each row has 9 LEDs (Y0 - Y8).
 One LED stands for one pixel. The first LED labeled X0 and Y0 is the origin.
 There are two ways to indicate it: 0 or (0,0). Each LED has 8-bit grayscale,
 that is, 256 levels of brightness. 0 is off and 255 is full brightness.

 The display has 8 seperate frames from 0 to 7. You can show any of them or
 display in turns to create an animation.
 
 You can also regard the LED matrix as a 9x16 screen and use `MadDisplay`
 to display text on it.
 
 - Attention: If you set all pixels to full brightness, the module will require
 too much current. So you may need to connect an external power supply
 instead of the computer's USB port. And if you hear buzzing from it,
 don't worry, it's because it works quickly to switch LED on and off.
